Here is a draft README.md file for the Articulate project focusing on Docker, React and Express:

# Articulate

Articulate is an AI-powered web application that converts text to images and answers questions using visualizations.

## Architecture

The application is built using:

- React - Frontend framework 
- Express - Backend framework
- Docker - For containerization

## Docker Setup

The React frontend and Express backend are containerized separately:

```
# Frontend
FROM node:14-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

```
# Backend
FROM node:14-alpine
WORKDIR /app 
COPY . .
RUN npm install
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

To build and run the containers:

```
# Build images
docker build -t react-app . 
docker build -t express-server .

# Run containers
docker run -p 3000:3000 react-app
docker run -p 8080:8080 express-server
```

## Local Development

For local development without Docker:

```
# Frontend
cd react-app
npm install
npm start
```

```
# Backend
cd express-server 
npm install
node server.js
```

The React frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000 and the Express backend at http://localhost:8080
